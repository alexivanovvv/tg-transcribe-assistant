# FORMATS: Supported Audio Formats and AAC Processing 🎵⚙️

The Whisper API (specifically Groq's Speech-to-Text service) natively supports a specific set of audio file formats. However, Telegram voice messages and audio files are often delivered in formats like raw ADTS-AAC streams, Apple CAF, or raw AMR/GSM bitstreams, which are not natively supported and must be processed or re-wrapped.

## 1. Supported Formats

### 1.1. Natively Supported Formats

According to the official [Groq Speech-to-Text Documentation](https://console.groq.com/docs/speech-to-text#working-with-audio-files), the natively supported audio formats are:
* **flac**
* **mp3**
* **mp4**
* **mpeg**
* **mpga**
* **m4a** (standard container formats containing AAC or ALAC)
* **ogg** / **oga** / **opus** (Ogg container formats containing Opus or Vorbis codecs)
* **wav**
* **webm**

Additionally, files must be within size limits (typically **25 MB** for the Groq free tier) and have a valid audio track.

### 1.2. Non-Native Formats (Supported via WAV Container Wrapping)

To support non-native and raw audio streams without introducing heavy dependencies like FFmpeg or WebAssembly, the bot implements a pure-JS containerization strategy. These formats are detected, wrapped on-the-fly into a standard WAV container, and transmitted to the Whisper API as `audio/wav`:
* **aac** (raw ADTS-AAC streams, sometimes saved by external recorder apps and incorrectly named with a `.m4a` extension)
* **caf** (Apple Core Audio Format containing AAC payload, sent as a document when iOS users share audio files from Voice Memos or similar apps)
* **amr** (AMR-NB, Adaptive Multi-Rate Narrowband)
* **awb** (AMR-WB, Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband)
* **gsm** (GSM 06.10 Full Rate raw files)
* **al** / **alaw** (A-Law raw PCM audio)
* **ul** / **ulaw** / **mulaw** (Mu-Law/u-Law raw PCM audio)

This allows the bot to seamlessly process and transcribe Telegram's native voice formats without losing audio quality or requiring resource-heavy re-encoding.

## 2. Format Validation & Rejection

### 2.1. Early Extension Validation & MIME Mapping

In the Telegram bot implementation, supported formats are verified and mapped in two stages to handle edge cases where Telegram metadata is generic or missing:

1. **Document Regex Matching (Early Gating)**:
   When files are sent as documents (rather than voice/audio messages), Telegram often labels them with a generic MIME type like `application/octet-stream`. To ensure these are not falsely rejected, the bot matches the file name extension against a supported media regex:
   `/\.(mp3|mp4|mpeg|mpga|m4a|wav|webm|ogg|oga|opus|flac|amr|awb|gsm|caf|aac|al|alaw|ul|ulaw|mulaw)$/i`
   This allows `.flac` and other natively supported formats, as well as convertible formats like `.amr` or `.caf`, to bypass prefix-based MIME requirements (`audio/` or `video/`).

2. **MIME Mapping for the Whisper API**:
   The Whisper API requires a correct `Content-Type` header (e.g. `audio/flac`, `audio/wav`, `audio/mpeg`) in the multipart form upload. If the file is uploaded with an incorrect or generic MIME type (such as the default `audio/ogg`), the API will fail to decode it.
   The bot parses the file extension and maps it to the precise MIME type:
   * `.flac` -> `audio/flac`
   * `.mp3` -> `audio/mpeg`
   * `.m4a` / `.mp4` -> `audio/mp4`
   * `.webm` -> `audio/webm`
   * `.wav` -> `audio/wav`
   * `.ogg` / `.oga` / `.opus` -> `audio/ogg` (normalized to `.ogg` extension)

3. **Media Format and MIME Validation**
   * When implementing file or media validation logic, never reject a file solely because it has a generic, binary, or empty MIME type (such as `application/octet-stream` or `application/x-zip-compressed`) if its file extension is in the supported formats list.
   * Only reject unsupported formats by explicitly targeting known unsupported MIME types (e.g. `video/quicktime`) or known unsupported file extensions (e.g. `.mov`, `.mkv`).
   * Always verify that files with generic MIME types but valid extensions (like `audio.webm` or `music.flac` sent as generic documents) are allowed to proceed to downstream processing.

### 2.2. Unsupported Video Formats Rejection

Since the bot runs in a serverless environment without heavy media utilities (such as FFmpeg), parsing and extracting audio from heavy, unsupported video containers like **MOV**, **MKV**, or **AVI** is not feasible.

To prevent unnecessary resource usage, timeouts, and API errors, the bot automatically rejects these formats during the validation step:
* Supported video formats: **MP4** and **WebM** (which Whisper supports natively for audio extraction).
* Rejected video formats: **MOV**, **MKV**, **AVI**, **3gp**, **flv**, **wmv**, **m4v**, etc.
* When an unsupported video is received, the bot responds with a localized error message explaining the supported video formats.

## 3. Format Detection & Processing

### 3.1. Format Detection (Magic Bytes)

File extensions alone cannot be trusted: audio files with an `.m4a` extension may contain
a raw ADTS-AAC stream rather than a proper MP4 container. Without inspecting the raw bytes,
such a file would be sent to the Whisper API with the wrong MIME type and fail. The bot
therefore inspects the first bytes of every downloaded stream to detect the true codec:

* **AMR-NB**: Starts with `#!AMR\n` (`0x23, 0x21, 0x41, 0x4D, 0x52, 0x0A`).
* **AMR-WB**: Starts with `#!AMR-WB\n` (`0x23, 0x21, 0x41, 0x4D, 0x52, 0x2D, 0x57, 0x42, 0x0A`).
* **Apple CAF**: Starts with `'caff'` (`0x63, 0x61, 0x66, 0x66`).
* **ADTS-AAC**: Starts with the 12-bit sync-word `1111 1111 1111` (`0xFFF`), so `buffer[0] === 0xFF` and `(buffer[1] & 0xF0) === 0xF0`.

For formats that lack a reliable binary signature — **GSM**, **A-Law**, and **Mu-Law** —
detection falls back to the file extension. The extension is derived from the `file_path`
returned by the Telegram `getFile` API (e.g. `documents/file_ABC123.alaw`). Since
`getFile` must be called regardless to construct the file download URL, using its
`file_path` as the extension source adds no extra cost. In practice, Telegram preserves
the original file extension in `file_path`, so it matches the `file_name` from the
message object — but note that this behaviour is not formally guaranteed by the Bot API.

### 3.2. WAV Container Wrapping

Instead of transmuxing to M4A, the bot generates a lightweight, 46-byte RIFF-WAV header on-the-fly and prepends it to the raw stream. 

#### ADTS-AAC & CAF Wrapping (tag `0x1600`)
For raw ADTS-AAC buffers:
1. The ADTS header is parsed to extract the sampling rate and channel count.
2. A 46-byte WAV header is built using:
   - `wFormatTag` = `0x1600`
   - `cbSize` = `0`
3. The WAV header is concatenated with the raw ADTS-AAC buffer.

For Apple CAF files:
1. The file structure is parsed (extracting `'desc'`, `'pakt'`, and `'data'` chunks).
2. The raw AAC frames are extracted.
3. A 7-byte ADTS header is generated for each raw AAC frame.
4. The generated ADTS frames are concatenated and wrapped in the `0x1600` WAV container.

#### AMR, GSM & log-PCM Wrapping
For raw bitstreams, the bot prepends a WAV header using the registered codec tags:
* **AMR-NB**: Tag `0x0057`, sample rate 8000 Hz, 1 channel. Standalone AMR file header (`#!AMR\n`) is stripped before wrapping.
* **AMR-WB**: Tag `0x0058`, sample rate 16000 Hz, 1 channel. Standalone AWB file header (`#!AMR-WB\n`) is stripped.
* **GSM 6.10**: Tag `0x0031`, sample rate 8000 Hz, 1 channel, block alignment 65 bytes, `wSamplesPerBlock` = 320.
* **A-Law / U-Law**: Tags `0x0006` / `0x0007`, sample rate 8000 Hz, 1 channel.

## 4. Webhook Integration Flow

When a file is received:
1. **Range Check (for unknown/non-native formats > 5 MB)**:
   - Perform a partial HTTP request (`Range: bytes=0-63`) using fetch stream cancellation.
   - Run format detection on the first bytes.
   - If the format is unknown or unsupported, immediately abort processing and reply with a friendly format error to save network/RAM resources.
2. **Download & Process**:
   - If valid, download the rest of the file.
   - Wrap the audio stream in a WAV container.
   - Set the MIME type to `audio/wav`.
3. **Transcribe**:
   - Send the constructed WAV buffer to the Groq Whisper API.
