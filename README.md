# Telegram Voice Transcribot 🎤🤖

A high-performance Telegram [bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots) that transcribes voice messages and audio files into clean text
using the **[Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) API**
(by default: free-tier [groq](https://groq.com/) service). 

It is designed to run completely **serverless**, making it fast, free, and incredibly simple to deploy.

---

## ☁️ Serverless!

Deploying this bot as a Serverless Function gives you incredible benefits compared to traditional hosting:
- **Zero Cost**: Generous free tiers on Vercel, Cloudflare, Deno, and Val Town mean you pay absolutely nothing.
- **Zero Maintenance**: No need to rent a VPS, manage operating systems, or keep background scripts running 24/7.
- **Instant & Efficient**: Unlike traditional containers that suffer from slow cold starts and waste resources by idling,
  your serverless bot wakes up instantly to process messages and scales down to zero immediately after. No idle waste!

## 🏆 Why Transcribot vs Telegram Premium?

Telegram has built-in voice transcription. Why deploy your own bot?
- **Superior Quality**: Works noticeably more accurately by better understanding context, jargon, and accents.
- **Lightning Fast**: Transcriptions arrive almost instantly.
- **Zero Clicks**: Automatically replies with text. No need to click "→A" for every message.
- **Free Forever**: Works without a Telegram Premium subscription.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Audio & Video Note Transcription**:
  Transcribes standard voice messages, audio files, and Telegram [video notes] (circles) automatically.
- **Direct Chat**:
  Send or forward voice messages directly to the bot in a private chat.
- **Group Mode**:
  Add the bot to any group chat to transcribe voice messages for all members.
- **[Guest] Mode**:

## 🤖 Creating Your Telegram Bot

Before deploying, you need to register a new bot and configure its privacy.

1. Open [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram.
2. Send the `/newbot` command and follow the prompts to choose a name and username.
3. Copy the **HTTP API Token** provided by BotFather. This is your `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once the bot is running, additional settings (active modes, transcription language, model, notifications, and more)
> can be configured directly from Telegram via the `/help` command.

<details>
<summary>Click to view Privacy Configuration Guide</summary>

#### Restricting Direct Interactions
By default, anyone can start a chat and interact with your bot.
To prevent unauthorized usage and protect your API limits, you can restrict access to specific users:
1. Open the **@BotFather**'s [Mini App](https://t.me/BotFather?startapp).
2. Select your bot and navigate to **Bot Settings**.
3. Scroll down to the **Access** section at the bottom.
4. Here, you can disable public access and explicitly specify which users are allowed to use your bot.

#### Group Privacy Settings
To control what messages the bot can read when in a group:
1. Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and send `/setprivacy`.
2. Select your bot.
3. Set it to **Enabled** (this is the default).
  In this mode, the bot will only see voice/audio files explicitly sent as replies to it or when it is mentioned.
  If you want the bot to transcribe *every* voice message in the group automatically, set this to **Disabled**
  (which requires the bot to have "Access to Messages" permission).

---

The following settings are also available via the bot's personal chat:

<details>

#### Restricting Group Additions
By default, anyone can add your bot to a group chat. You can disable this:
1. Open a chat with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
2. Send the `/setjoingroups` command.
3. Select your bot and set it to **Disabled**. Now, only you (the creator) can add it to groups.

#### Enabling Guest Mode
To allow users to mention the bot in any chat to transcribe forwarded voice messages without adding it to the chat:
1. Open a chat with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
2. Select your bot → **Bot Settings** → **Guest Chat Mode**.
3. Set it to **Enabled**. For details, see [Guest] Bots.

#### Enabling Secretary Mode
To connect the bot directly to your personal Telegram account as a personal secretary to transcribe incoming voice messages:
1. Open a chat with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
2. Select your bot → **Bot Settings** → **Secretary Mode** (also known as _Business Mode_).
3. Set it to **Enabled**. For details, see [Secretary] Bots.

## 🔗 Hooking Telegram to your Deployment

1. Once your deployment is live, just **open your bot's URL in a browser** (e.g. `https://your-bot.example.com/`) - 
   the webhook is configured **automatically**.  
   *Note: The bot pre-validates the URL to ensure it is secure HTTPS, uses Telegram-supported ports [80, 88, 443, 8443],
   does not resolve to localhost.
   If validation fails, it displays a dashboard warning, keeping any existing production webhook intact.*
2. **Send any private message to your bot** in Telegram.
   The bot will automatically recognize you as the owner, and greet you with a settings panel.

That's it — the bot is live! 🎉 Send a voice message to test transcription.

## 🔄 Staying Up to Date

If you deployed Transcribot by forking the repository on GitHub, you can receive upstream updates automatically.

The repository includes a **GitHub Actions workflow** (`.github/workflows/sync.yml`) that runs every **Sunday at 00:00 UTC**
and pulls new commits from the upstream [`PublicAffairs/tg-transcribot`](https://github.com/PublicAffairs/tg-transcribot) repository into your fork.

By default, GitHub disables Actions in newly forked repositories. If you **want** automatic weekly syncs, you must manually enable the workflow:
1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub fork.
2. Click the green button **"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"**.
